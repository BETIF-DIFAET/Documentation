Welcome to BETIF/DIFAET Computing Infrastructure  documentation!
================================================================

The **BETIF/DIFAET Collaboration** is a joint effort between the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (**INFN**) and the Physics Department (**DIFA**) of the University of Bologna, with the objective of creating a computing infrastructure and analysis platform for the Einstein Telescope (ET) community. 

ET is a proposed underground infrastructure to host a third-generation, gravitational-wave observatory. It builds on the success of current, second-generation laser-interferometric detectors Advanced Virgo and Advanced LIGO, whose breakthrough discoveries of merging black holes (BHs) and neutron stars over the past 5 years have ushered scientists into the new era of gravitational-wave astronomy.  The Einstein Telescope will achieve a greatly improved sensitivity by increasing the size of the interferometer from the 3km arm length of the Virgo detector to 10km, and by implementing a series of new technologies. These include a cryogenic system to cool some of the main optics to 10 â€“ 20K, new quantum technologies to reduce the fluctuations of the light, and a set of infrastructural and active noise-mitigation measures to reduce environmental perturbations.

        **Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
        that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
        It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
        and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

        Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
        how to :ref:`installation` the project.
