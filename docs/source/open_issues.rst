Open Issues and Next Steps
==========================

#. Open the static IP of the master node for connection from outside the host to the JupyterHub entrypoint without the need of establishing the SSH/proxy connection;
#. Creation of dedicated groups in the Einstein Telescope IAM for admins and users to start giving access to the computing resources to the ET community;
#. Passthrough of the GPUs installed to the VMs and their inclusion in the flavour of images available;
#. Creation of a "cocktail" of tools, platforms and software needed for the ET community.
